<h2>About</h2>

<div class="jumbotron"><p>I have been a web and application developer for over 15 years.  In this period I have worked primarily with back-end server technologies such as PHP, ASP.NET, classic ASP, JavaScript, and multiple databases.  My projects have included work in the fields of e-commerce, transportation, retail, engineering, health care, and non-for-profit, among others.  For me, programming is really just a big logic puzzle.  How do I take a real-world challenge a client has - like moving their daily processes off of paper - to create an easy-to-use, effective web application that makes their job or life better?
